Please see the example below:\r\n\r\n    --- !ruby/hash:SymbolHash\r\n    :yard-sftp:\r\n     host: 'example.com'\r\n     base_path: '/home/public_html'\r\n     base_folder: 'project_one'\r\n     username: 'username'\r\n     password: 'password'\r\n\r\nOnce this is all setup hit `yard` at your command line as you normally would and each file will uploaded via SFTP as they are created. Please note that both the `.yardoc` and `doc` directories are uploaded!\r\n\r\n### `.yardsftp` config file? Why?\r\nI've added a new `.yardsftp` so different projects can be uploaded to custom remote locations. I did attempt to add these to the global `.yard/config` file but there was no way to distinguish custom remote file paths between different projects! Please email if you have a good suggestion!\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\nThere are a no tests at present, this project was a proof of concept but these will be done at some point.\r\n\r\n## Feedback\r\nI would be more than happy to recieve feedback, please email me at: jonathan.chrisp@gmail.com\r\n","google":"UA-38101452-5","note":"Don't delete this file!
